# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Built a calculator app using Tkinter and began the process of learning Tkinter.

**Thoughts:** After several months of learning Python fundamentals every day and building a strong foundation 
I am ready to step up my game by learning new framworks and increasing my knowledge through building daily projects.

### Day 2: August 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tkinter 2048 game from a tutorial by kite.  Image viewer from codemy tutorial

**Thoughts**: I understand the logic of these programs more and more with each day.  Certain bugs I still have trouble with and will need to come back and refactor this code to get the 2048 game working flawlessly, even though I understand what is causing the problems I will return to get it working 100% properly in the future, but for now I would prefer to keep moving  forward rather than focus on small bugs from a tutorial.  Also starting Codewars is helping me fully understand how to write code that would be used in production and how there are multiple ways to achieve the same results by writing different functions.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
