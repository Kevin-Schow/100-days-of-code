# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Built a calculator app using Tkinter and began the process of learning Tkinter.

**Thoughts:** After several months of learning Python fundamentals every day and building a strong foundation 
I am ready to step up my game by learning new framworks and increasing my knowledge through building daily projects.

### Day 2: August 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tkinter 2048 game from a tutorial by kite.  Image viewer from codemy tutorial

**Thoughts**: I understand the logic of these programs more and more with each day.  Certain bugs I still have trouble with and will need to come back and refactor this code to get the 2048 game working flawlessly, even though I understand what is causing the problems I will return to get it working 100% properly in the future, but for now I would prefer to keep moving  forward rather than focus on small bugs from a tutorial.  Also starting Codewars is helping me fully understand how to write code that would be used in production and how there are multiple ways to achieve the same results by writing different functions.

### Day 3: August 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed an Image viewer app, completed several harder kata in codewars

**Thoughts** Between learning Norwegian, learning python and a few of it's frameworks, reading textbooks daily, taking courses on Udemy and coursera, using every website and tutorial I can possibly find, I feel like I am off to a great start on my coding journey.  Now that I have the fundamentals down the real journey is beginning and this is the start of the fun.

### Day 4: August 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A lot of practice using Tkinter building small functions for popups, dialogue, message boxes, new windows.  Continue Udemy tutorial Zero to Mastery and read Python All in One

**Thoughts** Even on slow days I still feel productive making  sure I get a few hours of coding in and fit some of my class and reading time in when I can.

### Day 5: August 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode Day 5: worked a lot on #Tkinter address book database App, GUI practice, finished other #python tutorials to broaden Tkinter knowledge, #codewars, #duolingo #Norwegian, #Udemy, #codemy @AndreiNeagoie @AlSweigart thank you.

**Thoughts** Getting a lot better with Tkinter and Python.  Really understanding how it all comes together and I can see a path forward building more intricate apps.  A Lot of big projects incoming over the next weeks.

### Day 6: August 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Complted Address Book from Udemy Tutorial

**Thoughts** Feels good to complete apps with tangible gui interface that accomplishes a task.  This will lead to many more big projects.

### Day 7: August 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Weather Air Quality app, Matplotlib Chart, MySQL

**Thoughts** So many new toys to play with, programming opens up a whole ne world of possibilities.

### Day 8: August 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: ASCII Art App that turns photos into text, Made a valiant attempt at using FoxDot sound synthesizer but got lost and will need to return in the future to properly learn how to use this amazing plugin.  Researched AI Chatbots and how to approach manking one soon.  Returned later in the day unsatisfied and decided to build my own synthesizer.  Also built a keylogger while trying to understand keyboard inputs for synth.

**Thoughts** I was amazed by the speech and audio synthesis in FoxDot and spent a few hours trying to get it up and running but ran into several issues, mainly my lack of knowledge. It felt good coming back after a workout and deciding  to keep going despite my lack of knowledge, instead of playing with a prebuilt synthesizer I instead began building my own by piecing together tutorials and learning a lot in the process.

### Day 9: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning a tool called Banjo's Backpack to mod Banjo Kazooie n64 game files suggested to me by Mark Kurko.  Continued Zero to Mastery Python.

**Thoughts** Not a lot of coding today but set myself up for a major project involving 3D modeling, texturing, game editing, and eventually programming in assembly for n64.

### Day 10: August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Customer Relations Manager Database v1, Zero to Mastery Python

**Thoughts** Slightly dry stuff today, learning more SQL which will help in many future projects.  Working more on Banjo Kazooie hack tonight after some Udemy.

### Day 11: August 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on Customer Relations Database including writing .csv files and displaying data properly.  Reading Python for Dummies.  Finally got a working pipeline set up for Banjo's Backpack using Maya so I can import custom 3D models into the game.

**Thoughts** Making great progress on my programming studies.  I am now at a point where I am comfortable spending some time on my two big side projects Hype and a Banjo Kazooie rom hack.  Life is currently code, art, repeat.

### Day 14: August 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tkinter practice exercises, bind keyboard events, classes, overwrite labels, Zero to Mastery Python

**Thoughts** It's pretty cool seeing how a new skill will connect with a previously learned skill and understanding how they will work together to create something new.  Beginning to understand how it all comes together and I plan on building apps using my current knowledge over next few days before moving forward with more tutorials to engrain that gained knowledge.
